1. Before anything, set up the trial page and the friends page (blanks) so at least there's something after home page. 
2. set up a test page where you just get automatically get marked as isAuthenticated and a test page where you sign out as well
	after this is set up, test out the two versions of the web page. Cannot test properly right now without being able to log on. 
3.alternative is to ask them if I can see the mysql table if i cant manually set isAuthenticated 
Misc. also need to change regis/login so whenever it's down it leads you to the Profile page.
